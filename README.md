# sat_problem 

**Note:** To insert a script from github, we change `raw.githubusercontent.com` in the raw link to `cdn.rawgit.com`.
For example, the raw link of the javascript in this repo is
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tran-Thu-Le/sat_problem/main/code.js
```
change it to 
```
https://cdn.rawgit.com/Tran-Thu-Le/sat_problem/main/code.js
```
and then you can use this new link in your html file.
